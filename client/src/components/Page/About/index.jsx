Our members span the gammute in terms of age and experience, but they all have one thing in common, they are learning something new, taking their software development skills to the next level and getting ready for the next step in their career.</p>
      <p>Tri-Valley Coders meets every Thursday from 9:00am to 12:00pm with emphasis on Web development and the MERN Stack. We also have periodic meetings focused on Python and Data Science. Check our schedule below for dates and times.</p>
